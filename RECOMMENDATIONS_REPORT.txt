## ETHICS AND LIMITATIONS
======================================================================

### Potential Biases in Review Data:

1. **Negative Review Bias:**
   - Users with negative experiences are more likely to leave reviews
   - This may skew sentiment analysis toward negative outcomes
   - Mitigation: Consider that actual user satisfaction may be higher

2. **Selection Bias:**
   - Only users who download and use the app can leave reviews
   - Users who uninstall immediately may not be represented
   - Mitigation: Reviews represent engaged users, not all potential users

3. **Temporal Bias:**
   - Reviews span multiple years (2018-2025)
   - Recent app updates may not be fully reflected
   - Mitigation: Focus on recent reviews for current state assessment

4. **Language Bias:**
   - Analysis focused on English-language reviews
   - May not represent all user segments
   - Mitigation: Consider multi-language analysis for comprehensive insights

5. **Rating Interpretation:**
   - 1-2 star ratings may indicate critical issues
   - 4-5 star ratings indicate satisfaction but may lack detail
   - Mitigation: Combined sentiment and rating analysis provides balance

### Data Limitations:
- Sample size: 1,200 reviews (400 per bank)
- Source: Google Play Store only (excludes iOS users)
- Time period: Reviews from 2018-2025
- Analysis method: Automated sentiment and theme extraction

### Recommendations for Future Analysis:
1. Collect reviews from multiple sources (iOS App Store, direct feedback)
2. Conduct user surveys to complement review analysis
3. Perform longitudinal analysis to track improvements over time
4. Include demographic analysis if available
5. Compare with industry benchmarks
