"Although the UI is simple and easy to use. That does not mean anything if information is not consistent throughout the app, and most services are down most of the time. Also, I see that forcing the user to turn off Android Dev Settings to use the app is unnecessary and creates inconvenience for users who want to use their devices for Android development 🙄. If you have certain security requirements, you would rather prefer to restrict the minSdk (since recent android releases are secure).",1,2025-07-16,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"WHAT A USELESS APP! Transfers, wallet payments, other banks — nothing works. Updated, restarted, cleared cache, reinstalled — still useless. Crashed and forced me to visit a branch just to log in 3 times. One of the biggest banks in the country can’t fix issues a junior developer could solve. Completely unreliable. Big bank , Zero functionality!",1,2025-09-13,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"Most of the time when I try to open the app, it does not load. The circle keeps spinning as if it is trying to open, and get a message saying "" 2 attempts left for offline login"". This seems to mean that the app cannot connect to the internet, even though I have a stable internet connection, and all other stuff work properly.",2,2025-09-24,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"I use the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia mobile app, and it’s fantastic! The interface is user-friendly, making it easy to check balances and transfer money. I love the bill payment feature, and the security measures give me peace of mind. Overall, it’s a reliable app that has simplified my banking experience. Highly recommend!",5,2025-08-22,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"It is good app and really user friendly , but it not possible to start service after the app is uninstalled or device phone is changed. So please make it easy for us, after once you set us the requirements in your office we should have to use it only by install and launch it. We do not have to visit the near by branch office every time for such silly businesses but important things. in addition to that why is that for hidding senders name or account number How can I know who tranfers to me???",4,2025-09-05,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"I love this app. really, but with some downsides too. Screenshot is mandatory after every transaction as to me, I need screenshots not downloaded recipient. It would be even better if transaction history is available via this app for months that we can access directly or via calender ways. Thanks.",4,2025-08-22,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"The app was great while it was active. However, after the app did an update, I lost connection with a message ""Network Error"". Please try to fix it as there are many clients of CBE using this app globally from abroad countries.",3,2025-09-21,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"The App is very good in its interface and user friendly. But it could be a pro app had it had additional feature that let us run multiple accounts on a single phone with an option of ""additional"" account!",3,2025-09-19,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"this app is pretty good. The recent one was the nicest. however after the update, it restricts me from taking a screenshot. i would be happy if you remove screenshots restriction policy from this app. why I gave it five stars was because of the past performances of this app. keep in mind to remove the screenshot restriction policy from this app. and also it has no self authorizations. once uninstalled it needs extra sim cards and wants to visit nearby banks in person.",5,2025-08-20,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"I would like to give you some feedback on Current update, its very nice and easy to use👍 but in some button there is still not improved For example while iwant to check my recent Txn it not well sequenced and arranged or some txn may not appear ... becouse of this i see many of users of this app discomferted maily merchants and those make High txn daily. improve and miximize the txn shown to 300 up to 500. make Searchable Recent txn button! All in all the bank i Relly on! CBE my bank !",5,2025-08-29,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store

"Amazing, Delightful and Seamless Mobile Banking Application, I have ever Experienced!! Indeed, I feel Great Proud to be part of your Stakeholder!

Thank you so much🙏",5,2025-09-06,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
3 stars because I can't see all my transaction history apart from the recents and a refresh button has been removed from the Recents activity. The app should allow clients to view all of the transactions not just recents.,3,2025-10-11,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"lately I am facing a problem with the app ,and the problem is when log in and inter my pin it doesn't work at all and says 'can't sync' why does it say that I was working fine a few day ago and also it says when I enter my pin 'change your pin to 6 digit pin and it doesn't allow me to change it please solve what is the problem with the app ?",2,2025-10-04,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"The app has a nice design and useful features like balance check and transfers, but it’s unstable and often fails to connect. It also forces users to turn off Developer Options, which is unnecessary — other banking apps work fine without that. Many people use Developer Mode for normal reasons. Please fix performance issues, remove this restriction, and add biometric login for better security and convenience",2,2025-10-19,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"it is very nice. but i have a serious suggestion when you send to other cbe birr customer, it does not show the name of the recipient befor it actually send the money. please improve this",4,2025-10-10,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"I like the application very much because it is user friendly and makes transactions easiest, especially for business matters. But, these few days I faced difficulties of opening it. I tried to uninstall and re install the app, and re verified at the nearest cbe center. But still failed to use all the functions. It says 'none available'. Any suggestions please!",3,2023-06-05,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
CBE needs to show transaction fees before the transaction is confirmed and not after. This is a big issue as fees are no longer insignificant.,3,2025-11-03,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"I have been using this app for almost four years now. In the beginning, it was working fine. Sometime later, it gets difficult to create a connection to my account, and could not manage to make and see transactions on my account. After updating it lately, Jul 2020, I was glad this app came with some user interface improvements, and the connection was quite fast. Not longer than two weeks, the app starts to get stuck, and it cannot even show me the UI properly. As a result, I have a useless app on my cell phone, hoping that [you] will soon come with updates.",2,2020-09-03,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"Application UI and new features are better than the previous version. I found a minor bugs though. I couldn't transfer to an account from the beneficiary list, it says None Available; There is still so much to do with the localization; Instead of ሰኔ it says ጁን and more like this; date conversion is missing also. If this minor things are fixed it will be much better.",3,2020-11-05,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"Most of the time, in the 'Recents' button the app becomes stuck and doesn't show up details of transactions and doesn't even scroll down; should be solved. Second, the app doesn't save the last pop-up screen when a transaction is complete. Third, there is no telebirr transfer to other person option and the app by default lets you to only own telebirr transfer.",4,2022-10-06,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"it's very nice simple and convenient app! but I have only one comment on double verifications after the finger prints. even thought its good for makin' it more secure, Its not neccessary to double verify after the finger print verification. no need to verify by pin again. thank you!",5,2025-08-22,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"The app has some issues I updated recently and now I am not able to send funds to my telebirr wallet, also we need to have a place we save our contacts where we usually send money to, after update I keep loosing all the important accounts.",4,2025-08-23,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"This app stooped working after i updated it. It says change password and i did, but it doesn't open with the new password. I don't like it.",1,2025-08-23,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"URGENT FIX REQUIRED!!! The app does not work anymore! Account balance is not displayed. Trying to use any service on the app shows error ""None available"". What is the point of an internet/mobile banking app if you cannot carry out banking services from your fingertips? I also don't want to reinstall because CBE activation code can only be recieved in the bank, which sounds very ridiculous. These days, banks send OTP to email, so customers can manage their account anywhere in the world.",1,2023-12-26,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"The CBE mobile banking app is a time-saver, but it needs several improvements, like adding fingerprint authentication. It's risky when people see me entering my PIN. Additionally, the fees are unreasonable. You could learn from Tele Birr, which adjusts fees based on the transaction amount. However, the CBEMB app charges a flat 10 birr fee for amounts between 5 and 1000 birr, which I think is unfair.",2,2024-09-04,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"Still needs development on several features.... For example - bank statements available online. The text feature of available balance and debited/credited notifications is very old school and involves too much digital trail. App doesn't always work, could be due to network issues in Ethiopia though. Another major issue is an error message is displayed when transferring from CBE to other banks. Ive almost lost a few thousands doing this once. Always cross check your balances.",1,2024-08-27,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"I think it is a good app to use easily. However, I have one more comment: the app does not automatically sync or update the balance in real time. Please review this issue. For example, when someone transfers money, the receiver's app does not sync automatically. It requires the user to manually initiate an update to see the current balance.",4,2025-09-04,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
the app constantly glitches and won't stop loading despite having a decent connection and a cleared cache. telebirr is way better,1,2025-11-10,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"With each update the app is getting slower and slower, specially when requesting transaction history. And I wish the logging process could be done easily. When someone changes a phone, it makes it mandatory to consult the branch and that makes it not to be self assisted. Hope you could fix it. Please add an option of transferring to other TeleBirr numbers other than the ""Own telebirr"" option. It id very limiting now a days",4,2023-08-11,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
The upgread is perfect and loved the new system could be accessed from any branch if u face problem in the application. The other thing if possible to add would be to expand the number of transaction be looked for all transaction back to a month period at list this will help review most transactions if there needs any review. The only problem I saw is that once a phone number is attached to another bank account # you need to provide another phone number to get the service. The rest is excellent,4,2020-07-31,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"Suddenly the cbe application I was using stopped working and called callcenter, I was told it's because it expired and I should vist any branch to fix it. So I went to CBE Silassie branch.After filling a form they gave me, I sat down and waited until they finish fixing 2 customer's case who arrived before me. But then when it was my turn ppl who came after me with same mobile banking and even Atm card cases were finishing up and leaving I had to get back to my work so I left.with no service.why?",1,2025-10-16,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
The app is user friendly. But i want some amendment or include option of sending money to other tele birr like other cbe birr.,4,2025-09-18,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
This app dash board is disturbing me. it is not showing me traxation and my balance while displaying others option on dashboard. I think it is a risk full app😭😭😭🤤🤤,1,2025-10-15,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
it will be more better if the app have the feature receipt verifying from QR CODE SCREENSHOT IMAGES FROM gallery ... currently IT WORKS ONLY FROM DIRECT CAMERA CAPTURING,4,2025-09-23,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
its easy to use and more secured than the previous one. i love it and appreciate commercial bank of ethiopia for every time update.,5,2025-10-16,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
this app is very useful but sometimes when you want to see specific transactions it didn't work so that way i gave 3,3,2025-09-20,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store

"The previous version is much better than this one. I used it for more than six years without any problem. But now I'm having a serious trouble with the updated app. I don't know why it takes him forever to refresh and load the home page once you sign in. And if it fails to load, it never recovers. I only see some UI changes. Really disappointed",2,2021-01-01,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"The most unreliable banking app i ever used, the transactions are stuck halfway and i can't access my money then when you call the call center they ask that you wait 3-5 business days before they return the money what is the point off having a banking app if the transactions are unreliable and incomplete I'd rate less if i could.",1,2025-06-25,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"once it is uninstalled, you need to visit a nearby bank. you go there and they ask you to have a new sim card which hasn't been used before. so you should buy a new sim card and you go back to them with a new sim card, when you reach there service provider says authentication pin is not arrive, the system is not working come back tomorrow.",1,2025-11-05,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"The app is awesome. But there are many things to highlight.For example, When spending money from the account , a confirmation text message must be sent to the account holder. Also the fact that, the PIN is only four digits is not safe enough for security, if it is more than eight digits and includes numbers and symbols, it will be cool.",3,2023-01-29,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"In fact, it's a good app to make our daily life easier! However, I have encountered several times issues with this app. 1. It's not always working with network error, even though the network is good on my phone. 2. It happened to me several times that when I transfer money to someone's account, I doubled the transfer! Or in another word, my money sent two times. If I wanted to send 10,000, I found that sent 20,000 because of the APP error. I hope this will be fixed soon.",1,2023-09-04,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"everytime you uninstall the app you have to reach them out physically. very oldy! if that's one of security layer, they'd check for fraud attempt via app source directly(source:- app store, play store ... etc) implicitly ! we are in 2025, physical presence for every app install is traditional(traditionally very rare).",1,2025-06-04,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store

"It's very good in reminding the account numbers you have been used, but Need to show recipient history whenever you want to present it.or it has to have a search on options for a spesfic time you want to look for receipts with out going for account details at bank. if you lost your receipt without downloading it and need to look sometime a while you can't get in simple search on the app.",1,2025-02-15,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"Its hard to trust this application coz while transfering money it transfers two times to the same account after only one transfer click and sometimes it says error but it actualy have transfered the money, so i only use it if it is mandatory unless its better to go to the bank, so it still doesn't solve the problem not to go to the bank, i am sure it have some systematic errors",1,2022-03-01,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"It is a very basic app. Banks nowadays offer many services through their app. I suggest you add the abilty to get statements, the ability to freeze the card if stolen or when traveling. The abilty to use the card while traveling. I have noticed that if Ieave Ethiopia it is not possible to pay my bills back home. So in general the app is very helpful and eased the burden of carrying money arroubd in Ethiopia, please improve it further.",4,2023-07-24,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
It works very well. I have two issues though 1/ it is not possible to transfer accounts in other Banks. 2/ the exoress money sending function dies not work as neither the recipient nor the sender get the secret number but the money will alrwady be sent. I had to go throgh a very lengthy process to get the money back with the transfer fee already deducted. In the end I lost three days plus the transfer fee for teying to send money fast. Other than these issues it does the rest of the job well.,3,2021-09-15,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"Currently the app is not working becuase I think they forgot to update it. It always shows'sync failed''. And there is no customer service online. People living abroad are having problems. It is a big shame. It is very annoying and not user friendly, People are using CBE just becuase salary is transferd there. The app is a total failur.",1,2022-02-06,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"I have been using this app for more than a year it came with best version, but now after the last update it's not working well as before. It can't sync, the connection is not working at all. I can't see recent transactions and make any transfer , all the features are not working, I hope you will come with a better update soon.",2,2020-09-12,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"This app has several issues based on my experience. Below are the problems that I encountered: 1. The app frequently crashes. 2. It only shows a limited transaction record history (25 transactions). 3. You can't access the transaction records after 8:00 pm and on Sundays. 4. It displays a ""payment failed"" message. It would be greatly appreciated if you could address these issues",1,2024-08-25,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"Sometimes it brings a contradicting notifications. First I saw an internet poll form. After I filled it, another message comes that advises users not fill any forms sent or bank did not send such documents. Sometimes the app gets stack without any prior notices. It happened quite numerical times with me. Otherwise great app. I think a followup maintenance and improvements needed",3,2024-03-09,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"Poor application. Let me list down if you could update the main features. It say error while the money has already sent. We can't get the transaction record (it has limited date) or somtimes the listed record transactions and the details are not the same while we enter to see further details. So if you can, try to see telebirr application and how much simple it is then try to update frequently.",1,2024-07-02,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
The app keeps on crushing & I can't log in or access my account. Went to the bank for trouble shooting. The customer service was very poor and I told to reinstall the app and enter new activation key. I did and after starting to work for few hours again the prob is there and the app is still crushing and not working. Such poor service is unexpected from a big statd owned bank. You should fix the problem ASAP.,1,2019-03-06,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"I love this app. It's simple to use and syncs fast. The only issue I had was the balance shows only what's on the ledger, there is no way to tell what the actual balance is. I learn about the difference between the two balance types the hard way on an ATM machine. I would love to see that fixed in your next update.",5,2021-09-25,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"It is a nice app compared to the previous one. I appreciate you have included local language but the details in the Amharic section will return to English mode, please fix that problem plus additional local language will increase its usability. Also it would be nice if the terms and conditions agreements, security tips, charge and transfer limits.... are included in the app.",4,2020-07-26,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"The 'unsubscribe' button in the CBE Android app is misplaced. It should be at the middle of the menu or somewhere else rather than at the end. The end is usually for a 'log out"" and I inadvertently touched ''unsubscribe"" many times. This could lead to customers accidentally unsubscribing from the service.",4,2024-11-11,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"It's a great app. I've been using this app since the bank launched it. As a long-term user, I would like to point out things that need to be improved. 1. Deleting money transfer history should be the user's choice. 2. There should be an option to download an in-depth transfer history for each transfer activity , just as there is posiblity to download a single time transfer recit. Do that and get 5 star.",3,2022-03-18,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"It is a service that is not expected from such a large institution. I saw that your work is very complicated. The user does not understand well your application. In general, you have many problems.

For instance I can't access my account from abroad what I depsited amount and transfer from my account to any any one .It is a shame.",1,2024-10-16,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"It is a good and progressive app through the updates. I think the app should further solve its bugs like 1. It doesn't download or share attachment on android 12 and 11, it used to work on android 10. 2. Sometimes transactions seem like they have failed and there are no records, but the transactions actually have passed this is a very serious issue, because people will try the transaction again which will end up doubling the payment.",4,2022-09-15,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"I really love this app,it is amazing. It is more flexible than any other banks app. The only and main problem that I encountered with this app is,if it is uninstalled from this devices, I have to go to the bank and mostly the specific barank the account is opened to reconfigur again. This is very unpractical in most cases,since people are traveling and very busy in their day to day activities. Kindly consider to change this option.",5,2023-09-11,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store

Easy to use and a lot of functionalities! Keep your eyes on two things: 1. The transactions shown in the Recent section are messed up (every time I refresh it it shows different output of order and messed transaction list) 2. What if we can transfer to other Telebirr number Finally the transaction fee for transfers made other than CBE acc is expensive.,4,2024-05-28,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store

"I have not seen anything like it in the Ethiopian banking industry. It is very easy to use, fast, and offers a wide range of services.

Thank you.",5,2023-05-23,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
Good app but it fail to send on time the commission money is unnecessary and also their are some bug like recent transaction page don't show the recent one ...... Try to improve it's back system as a bank system people want it in different situations so it has to work every time as could as possible if you don't get it when you want why we use mobile banking not branch service as I conclusion personally I like the bank because it is CBE but not their digital banking system Thanks,2,2024-05-12,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store

this app has developed in a very good ways but there are some comments I need to make 1- preventing the screenshot likely not good for someone like me coz I need to make screenshot for quicker evidence. 2-it would be good if you make us to access recent transaction histories for 30 days coz we don't have to go to the Bank's in person to see old transactions or add colander category so user can easily access old transactions through colanders.,5,2025-05-31,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store

It is a a much better App than other Private Banks. But you have to include the following options; 1. The Bank Statement should be Unlimited. It should allow to see all Transactions by Tracing Back. No Need to Limit it with only one Page Transaction (May be 10Page). 2. You have to Work on transferring Money to other Banks too. You can ask additional payment for it. But the Service will be Essential for Us.,5,2021-09-21,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
